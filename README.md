# The Rust Specification

## The Spec and the Rust Reference

** The Rust specification is currently being developed as part of the [Rust Reference](https://github.com/rust-lang/reference).

The [`t-spec`](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/lang#team-spec) team, in consultation with interested parties from the Rust Project, made the decision on a [go-forward plan](https://hackmd.io/d-8LXh2NTASg7NF-zmZqNA?both#Review-go-forward-plan) that makes the Rust Reference the source of truth and the specification will be based on that content. 

It is currently unclear what happens to both this repository and the Rust reference once we are at a steady-state of having a usable specification. It is likely we will consolidate the two repositories into one that ends up being called the specification. Stay tuned for more information on that.
